Tethys Thesis is a LaTeX template for computer science theses and project
documentation.

## Introduction

Tethys Thesis is a template heavily based upon my own workflow on projects and
LaTeX experience taylored towards computer scientists. It may not suit you, but
at least it suits me well.

Notable choices include:

* Bibliography is handled with biblatex, not bibtex
* For listings, Minted is used instead of lstlistings
* For algorithms, the package *algpseudocode* is used
* Running `make repeatedly` runs latexmk, making it easier to do "agile" LaTeX
  development
